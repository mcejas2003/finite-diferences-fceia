# finite-diferences-fceia
Finite elements program that solves an initial value problem and graphs the function solution in 3D.
It's a rework on Python of the original project that I coded in MatLab which output was a _.txt_ file which was used to graph the solution of the initial value problem on LaTeX. Here, you can modify the step length and the function is fixed to the one that was given to me to solve. It could be changed to whatever _IVP_ but, unfortunately, I didn't take the time to code it.
